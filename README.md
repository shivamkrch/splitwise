# SplitWise Clone

TypeScript class with basic SplitWise functionalities. Add expenses and track balances.

## TODOs
- Add frontend
- Add name of expense
- Maintain expense history (overall and per user)
- Option to split by share.
    - Ex: 'User4 pays and everyone splits equally. You pay for 2 people.' could be added as: `u4 1200 4 u1 u2 u3 u4 SHARE 2 1 1 1`
